*Any Bells and Whistles (or other enhancements) you went for.
  -I tried to make the arts and the layouts look good 


 *Crediting any artwork you used that was not your own, and where you found it who made it.
	Google images:
		chowchow.jpeg, chihuahua.jpeg, minus.png, plus.jpeg, cute.png
	My own arts:

 *Any known bugs you encountered.
	Since Im not very familiar with JavaScript, I have encountered a lot of bugs, such as Rendering bug, import bug, element type is invalid, component exception. Sometimes I mixed up useState and useReducer, and I spent most of the time messing with the layouts. 


*Anything else youd like me to keep in mind while playing your game 

I think my Character Creation Screen has a lot of problems. I couldn't get the counters work right and my buttons eventually let the users go beyond the allowed points. 
	Although my codes do not look very efficiently, I was able to show what I wanted to show in the game.
